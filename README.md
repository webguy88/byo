## Bomb Your Opponents: A single game made with Python and Pyglet

![](./resources/logo.png)

The mechanics are very simple...
The red and blue ships are the players, and they shoot bombs to each other.
To shoot bombs, you click on your opponent. If you are Red, you can click Blue, and viceversa.
To see how you or your opponent is doing, just hover your mouse over them
and you will see their "stats box".

YOUR goal is to drain his health to 0 HP. Have fun playing!

## How do I run this game?
You may run the game manually, whereas you'll need Pyglet and to be in the main folder (byo),
or in the releases tab, where the Windows and Linux files are.
To run on Windows just download it and double click it, but for Linux run the following
```
  $ git clone https://github.com/webguy88/byo.git
  $ cd byo
  $ ./bombgame
```
Else, just download the Linux file and run it as usual.

So, have fun! :)
